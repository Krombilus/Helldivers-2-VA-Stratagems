Helldivers 2 VA Stratagems by Krombilus & JackTehCatMan

Something I made during an entire Saturday, just because I thought it would be awesome.

It's not faster than learning the sequence and typing them by hand.
It won't help you learn the sequences.

It is, however, more convenient and feels immersive.
And will help less-dexterous helldivers in the fight to spread managed democracy across the galaxy.

How to use:

You can grab Voice Attack from Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3046550/VoiceAttack_v2
or here: https://voiceattack.com/Default.aspx

Every macro is set to the arrow keys, and the listening button is bound to left control.
If you don't have arrow keys, you can set your keybinds in-game by saying "Arrow Left" for the left arrow, etc.
"Arrow" is the listening override command, so if you need to use a terminal, it allows you to not hold control (which would boot you out of the terminal), it's tedious, it's slow, but its a workaround for now.

You can dial in stratagems one direction at a time by holding left control and saying the direction. There's no need to start with "arrow" for every direction in this situation. this is a catch-all that helps out with temporary stratagems that I haven't been able to add yet.

Start with one of 4 activations:
"Requesting/Calling/Dialing/Coding"
You can choose to say "In" or not.
You can choose to say "A/An" or not.
Then you can say the name of the stratagem.

I've tried my best to customize each stratagem so you can be extremely specific, and say the whole name, or as vague as you can be, and still be able to identify the specific stratagem

one example is the precision strike. You can either say:
"Calling in an orbital precision strike"
or "Requesting precision"

Some stratagems have nicknames, the 500kg bomb can also be called the Mini-Nuke or the Half-Ton.
Reinforce can also be called Reinforcements or Revive.
Resupply can also be called Ammo.

The full list of commands, keywords, and nicknames can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ixjsCEgo8R7u2qoUsRPYr0QQEi9jiekKbC1ECiAlRUw/edit?usp=sharing

I will update the profile whenever I have free time.

Edit 5/21/25: I've finally updated this up to the current warbond (Masters of Ceremony), with much help from u/JackTehCatMan both from his testing and his own additions when I didn't play much anymore.
